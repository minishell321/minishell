HEREDOC:
After reading (https://linuxize.com/post/bash-heredoc/), the heredoc identifier (<<) cannot
be followed by leading whitespace characters (e.g. space), only tabs.
If the heredoc identifier (<<) is followed by a hyphen (-), the leading tab characters will
be ignored.
	
	=> Currently, the way we are tokenising the heredoc, the function does not check for
	the hyphen (-) and increments the string position while spaces are found. This needs
	to be addressed but I would like to verify the behaviour in bash to double-check.

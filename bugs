HEREDOC:
After reading (https://linuxize.com/post/bash-heredoc/), the heredoc identifier cannot
be followed by leading whitespace characters (e.g. space), only tabs.
If the heredoc identifier  is followed by a hyphen (-), the leading tab characters will
be ignored.
	
	=> Currently, the way we are tokenising the heredoc, the function does not check for
	the hyphen (-) and increments the string position while spaces are found. This needs
	to be addressed but I would like to verify the behaviour in bash to double-check.



TODO LIST
exec_cmd/child_handler => use locale env not envp?
Remplacer tout les messages d erreur en utilisant la fonction perror
***************************************************************************************************

TEST 18 Mars

QUESTIONS;
makefile must not re-link? What does it means?

exit message error if argument is not number
need to redo exit like a real builtin  

readline history to free?

BUGS:
only space SEGFAULT ALSO tab
only tab pass to execve
FIXED - export NEWENV without value must not work

FIXED - cd to root using cd ..
FIXED - cd ~ doesn t work after reach /

FIXED - from /Users cd rburri/Desktop/ = SEGFAULT
FIXED - cd ~ + cd Music/ == SEG FAULT?

FIXED - cd without nothing = cd ..

FIXED - cd ~ => ok
		cd goinfre => ok
		cd ~ => not moving to home

FIXED - cd ~ => ok
		cd Music => segfault
		Only bug when start from home and to when going to goinfre and not from free but anytime trying to read cmd_table[0][0]


change error msg after PATH unset

<< EOF == SEGFAULT !?

remove debugging messages

Currently the function check_command does not have a general verification to detect special characters in all cases when they are outside quotes. Does such a general verification exist in the tokenizing?
